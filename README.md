## Code Refractoring Challenge

# Description

This is a completed bootcamp challenge where I was given the task of simulating what it would be like to receive a task from a marketing agency to enhance their SEO (Search Engine Optimization). To do this, I was given starter code, and my repsonsibility was to go through the HTML/CSS and refactor the code for improved accessbility and SEO. This challenge includes making sure the HTML follows a semantically logical structure, maintains SEO standards, and also beind mindful not to modify the function of the previous code.
